                            Risk Disclosure</strong><br>Trading foreign exchange on margin carries a high level of risk,
                        and may not be suitable for all investors. The high degree of leverage can work against you as
                        well as for you. Before deciding to invest in foreign exchange you should carefully consider
                        your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. The possibility exists that
                        you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment and therefore you should not
                        invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risk associated with
                        foreign exchange trading, and seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have any
                        doubts.<br><br><strong>Disclaimer</strong><br></p>

                        suitability of the service offered by Managed Forex, please seek independent financial advice.
                        There is always a relationship between high reward and high risk. Any type of market or trade
                        speculation that can yield unusually high returns is subjected to high risk. Only surplus funds
                        should be placed at risk and anyone who does not have such funds should not participate in
                        trading CFDs or Forex.</div><br>
